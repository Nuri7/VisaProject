		<p>We believe everyone should be given equal opportunities and those who are willing to work hard should be eligable to work in america. Not only will it benefit the economy it will increase the overall satisfaction of the population, by having hard working people do what they do best. Getting the chance to work on something great and which better place is there than the land of opprtunity and dreams. As seen in the video below, 50% of the PH.D student's in America are here on visas. That goes to show that the American individual, born and raised here is not fulfilling the educational requirements to see the progression of the country. Therefore, the solution would be to allow entry into the country by way of the visa.</p>

		<p>Many people are aware of Visa's being given out daily, but our goal is to provide a visa to the intelectual with dreams and aspirations of making the world a better place.</p>
